# BioFeedback

This is a Android application that communicate with a Bluetooth Zephyr Bioharness 3 belt that provides heart informations.

We used those informations to calculate the heart rate in real time.  
With a simple interface, we show this information to the user that wears the belt and he have to try to control it.  
This application will be used by a PhD student for his studies on biofeedback.
